I studied [Digital Media](http://digitalmedia-bremen.de/en) at the
[University of Bremen](http://uni-bremen.de/), Graphics Design at the
[Art Institute of Boston at Lesley University](http://www.lesley.edu/college-art-and-design/)
and Software Development and Technology at the
[IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk).

As of July 2015 I am working as a PhD student on spreadsheet array
programming as part ot the
[Popular Parallel Programming project](https://itu.dk/people/sestoft/p3). My
principal supervisor is
[Professor Peter Sestoft](https://itu.dk/people/sestoft). My secondary
superviser is [Yu Zhang](http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~yzhang) from the
[Institute of Software at the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://lcs.ios.ac.cn). I
am funded by the
[Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research](http://sinodanishcenter.com).

## Things I did and do ##

- Read my thesis [Connected Set Filtering on Shared Memory Multicore
Processors](files/thesis.pdf).

- Read my project [Morphological Segmentation of Blood Images for
Automated Malaria Diagnosis](files/morphological_segmentation_malaria.pdf).

- I programmed the first version of the gaze-controller Lego
  construction manual for children. It was featured on CES 2015 in Las
  Vegas and showcased in Lego stores in Copenhagen and Frankfurt. See
  the [ITU research video](IT University of Copenhagen).

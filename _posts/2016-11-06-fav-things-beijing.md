title: My Favorite Things To Do In Beijing

I have now spent about six months in Beijing. My Chinese is still pretty weak, I am behind schedule with my PhD and I probably still don't know half of the things you can do here, but here is a selection of my favorites in the Gulou area.

# Eat Jian Bing #

Jian Bing is a tasty crepe fried with an egg and filled with different sauces, coriander and a deep-fried Wonton. My favorite places are the [Andingmen metro station exit A](https://goo.gl/maps/2BYE3YGFwpy) and at the eastern end of [Gulou Dong Dajie](https://goo.gl/maps/PVdPm4BP6jw). At Andingmen they add some fermented relish, at Gulou Dong Dajie the Wonton is the most crisp.

# Buy Feiyue Sneakers #

If you want to wear awesome Chinese sneakers, you can buy [Feiyue shoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feiyue) at Natooke in [Wudaoying Hutong](https://goo.gl/maps/S2uAWp2ZyK42).

# Get a Used Bike #

Around 100 meters south of [Beixinqiao metro station exit D](https://goo.gl/maps/pZFkVAJJW3J2), on the right hand side, there is a shop that sells used bikes for very little money. I got a nice Giant racer there for only 200 Yuan.

# Drink Beer at Great Leap Brewing in the Hutong #

If the weather is nice and the pollution low, go and have great craft beer at the [Great Leap pub](https://goo.gl/maps/nK3LUdUvgHp) in Doujiao Hutong, close to Gulou (Drum Tower). Be early, it is quite popular.

# Get Coffee at Voyage Coffee #

My local coffee dealer in [Beiluoguxiang](). Nice little hutong caf√© where people spend hours taking selfies, rearranging the furniture if need be, to optimize the lighting. Incredibly nice staff and the only place where I managed to buy (actually _really_ nice) coffee beans for making coffee at home in the morning.

# Mr Shi's Dumplings #

Clearly targeting foreigners, this place just has the most delicious dumplings. There is one in [Baochao Hutong](https://goo.gl/maps/BzouoLAEaZ32) and I actually go there once every week or so. It got a little embarrassing recently when I showed up three days in a row. After renovations started in Baochao Hutong, their entrance was moved a bit away from the street. Hasn't affected their dumplings. Getting dumplings at Mr Shi's and then going to Great Leap is a great combo!

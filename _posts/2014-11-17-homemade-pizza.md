Homemade pizza is awesome and I can only recommend everyone to try it
for themselves. Per pizza, you'll need:

- 125g wheat flour
- 5g fresh yeast
- 50ml water
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- Salt

Put the lukewarm water into a bowl and dissolve the yeast in it. Add a
bit of salt and the olive oil. Then add the flour bit by bit until the
dough gets firm and somewhat dry. Take it out of the bowl and knead it
for around 10 minutes. Do not skip this part! It is important in order
for the gluten to "glue" the dough together. It'll get a nice texture
and should look something like this. Be generous with the flour if the
consistency won't match up.

Roll the dough into a long sausage and divide it in as many pieces as
you want to have pizzas. Roll them up into small balls nicely and put
them on a baking tray with some baking paper underneath and cover them
with a damp cloth and let them sit for an hour. Put some loose flour
on them to avoid the dough sticking to the cloth.

In the meantime, I usually prepare the tomato sauce:

- 1 can of shredded tomatoes
- 1 can of tomato paste
- 1 or 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 medium-sized onion
- Olive oil
- Again salt

Chop the onion and the garlic fine and put them into the hot olive
oil. Let them sit there for two minutes, then add the tomato paste and
stir well. After a couple of minutes, add the shredded tomatoes and
leave the sauce simmering without a lid so that it gets thick.

Preheat the oven to 220Â°C. Put a griddle on the lowest level and let
it preheat, too. That'll make the pizza really nice and crispy in the
bottom.

Take out the dough balls. They should have doubled in size. Put some
flour on a working surface and also cover the dough balls in flour
nicely. Because you already made nice round dough balls, it is now
easy to turn them into a nice and round pizza, each; use a rolling
pin! When rolled out, put them on a sheet of baking paper and add as
much sauce as you like. Also add cheese (I prefer mozarella) and
whatever vegetables or sausages you like. I myself like them as pure
as possible.

Put the pizza on the griddle and bake until the dough is crispy. When
done, take the pizza out and add some rucola salad and parmesan cheese
to each slice.
